# Document Analysis Methods

Execute targeted analysis with single-pass token efficiency. Parse exact method match from: think, distill, tag, guide, extract.

## think
Deconstruct document through speculative reasoning:
- Identify fundamental concepts and architectural patterns
- Generate self-consistent analysis revealing causal interconnections
- Verify reasoning through edge case exploration
- Output: Simplified Chinese, Markdown format, principle-first deep reasoning

## distill
Compress content while preserving structural integrity:
- Eliminate redundancy, amplify signal
- Maintain logical flow, reduce verbosity strategically
- Output: Structure-first compression with enhanced clarity

## tag
Extract 3-5 most relevant technical tags:
- Lowercase terms using concrete technical terminology (hyphen/comma separated)
- Zero marketing language, pure semantic descriptors
- Output: Single code block with search-optimized tags

## guide
Transform into pedagogical content:
- Progression from first principles to practical application
- Concrete examples demonstrating architectural decisions
- Output: Simplified Chinese, 2025-compatible learning progression

## extract
Expose deep design philosophy and system architecture:
- Engineering tradeoffs, architectural patterns, design decisions
- Causal analysis of why decisions were made, not just what was built
- Output: Principle-first reasoning documenting core design tenets
