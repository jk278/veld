# Comment Tags

## Tag System

- `CRITICAL`: System-dangerous: errors/crashes/data-loss
- `WARNING`: Potential risks, edge cases, non-obvious side effects
- `TODO`: Incomplete work, tech debt
- `NOTE`: Non-obvious design decisions, counter-intuitive implementations
- `QUERY`: Uncertain, needs confirmation, suspected bugs

## Tagging Principles

- Tag Sparingly: Code should be self-documenting
- Be Specific: One comment, one clear intent
- Add Value: Reveal non-obvious information
- Focus: Highlight non-trivial logic

## Refactoring

- Migrate tagged comments to new location before deletion.
